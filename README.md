## My Reads React Project

This application was created with ReactJS. It is a book reading tracker application that allows you to search for books and track whether or not you've read them, would like to read them, or are currently reading them, by placing the books on a respective shelf. You can move the books between the different shelves or select "none" to remove them from any shelf.

How to start the application:

* First, install node.js if you do not have it yet. It comes with npm(node package manage).
Make sure that you install node with the PATH variable so you can run node anywhere in your command prompt/terminal.
* Next, install the react package using this command in your terminal: npm install -g create-react-app.
* After installing the react package, you can either clone this repo or download it as a zip. if you download this as a zip, you will have to extract the files.
* In your terminal, change directory to the project root.
* To start the react app, run: npm start
* This will start the app in your default browser at: localhost:3000
